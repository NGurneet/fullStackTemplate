## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders for clarity and modularity:

```
app/
    common/         # Shared utilities and constants
    controllers/    # Handles API logic
    file/           # File handling services (upload, download, etc.)
    swagger/        # Swagger API documentation setup
    user/           # User management (authentication, roles, etc.)
    routes.ts       # Centralized API route definitions
config/             # Application configuration files (e.g., database, app settings)
uploads/            # Folder where files are uploaded
Dockerfile          # Docker configuration for containerizing the app
docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose setup for running the app with all dependencies
env.example.production # Example environment configuration for production
index.ts            # Main entry point for the application
nodemon.json        # Nodemon configuration for hot-reloading
package.json        # Project metadata and scripts
pnpm-lock.yaml      # Dependency lock file (for pnpm users)
tsconfig.json       # TypeScript configuration
```

## 🛠️ Scripts

### Available scripts for development and production environments:

- `npm run dev` - Runs the server in development mode (with live reloading using Nodemon).
- `npm run build` - Compiles the TypeScript files to JavaScript for production.
- `npm run start` - Starts the server (in production or after building).
- `docker-compose up` - Builds and starts the app with all dependencies in Docker (requires Docker and Docker Compose installed).

## 📖 API Documentation

You can find the **Swagger-generated API documentation** once the server is running at the following endpoint:

```
[BASE_URL]/api-docs
```

This provides detailed descriptions of all the available API endpoints, input/output formats, and authentication requirements.
